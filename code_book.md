# Description of the DATA and variables

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. and the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) – both using a low pass Butterworth filter.

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the ‘f’ to indicate frequency domain signals).
Description of abbreviations of measurements

    leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
    Body = related to body movement.
    Gravity = acceleration of gravity
    Acc = accelerometer measurement
    Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
    Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
    Mag = magnitude of movement
    mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.

    tBodyAcc-XYZ
    tGravityAcc-XYZ
    tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    tBodyGyro-XYZ
    tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
    tBodyAccMag
    tGravityAccMag
    tBodyAccJerkMag
    tBodyGyroMag

    fBodyAcc-XYZ
    fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    fBodyGyro-XYZ
    fBodyAccMag
    fBodyAccJerkMag
    fBodyGyroMag
    fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation


The tidy data set a set of variables for each activity and each subject. 
10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group. 
The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns – 33 Mean variables + 33 Standard deviation variables + 1 Subject( 1 of of the 30 test subjects) + ActivityName + ActivityNum . 
The tidy data set’s first row is the header containing the names for each column.
